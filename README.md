# React Shopping List

## Description

_Duration: 8 Hour Sprint_

Do you constantly go to the grocery store, only to forget what you needed to purchase? Have you ever forgotten something and had to turn around? With this app, this is a thing of the past!

With our shopping list, you can keep tabs on what you need to buy at home AND mark the item as purchased when you are in the store - all within a stylish and user friendly design!

## Screen Shot

Include one or two screen shots of your project here (optional). Remove if unused.

### Installation

1. Create a database named `fs-react-shopping`,
2. The queries in the `database.sql` file are set up to create all the necessary tables that you will need to have this app work correctly. The project is built on Postgres, so you will need to make sure to have that installed. We would recommend using Postico to run those queries as that was used to create the queries.
3. Open up your editor of choice and run an `npm install`
4. Run `npm run server` in one terminal and `npm run client` in another
5. A new browser tab will open automatically
6. Enjoy the app and get cooking!
